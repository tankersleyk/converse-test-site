    Bring the world of programming to life in your library with a hip hop coding workshop!
    <h3>What is this all about?</h3>
    <p class = 'info'><strong>Scratch</strong> is a graphical programming environment where you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations â€” and share your creations with others in the online community.</p>
    <p><strong>Hip hop</strong> culture has strongpowered youth to raise their voice, express their ideas through unique styles, and use technology in unexpected ways for decades.</p>
    <p><strong>Hip hop and coding</strong> both use terms and processes such as looping, rstrongixing, and sequencing. The natural relationship between these two worlds offers a fun opportunity to present workshops on both together!</p>
